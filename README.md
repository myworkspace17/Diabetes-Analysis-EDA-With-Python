🚀 Diabetes Prediction EDA Project
👋 Hi, I’m Hari (@myworkspace17)! Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m passionate about data analysis and machine learning. In this project, I demonstrate my expertise in Python for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset used to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health parameters.

🧠 About Me
I’m Hari, a Data Analyst and aspiring Data Scientist with experience in Python for data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling. My goal is to apply data science techniques to real-world problems and provide actionable insights. This project highlights my skills in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and data visualization.

🚀 About the Project: Diabetes Prediction EDA
Objective:
The goal of this project is to explore a dataset to understand the key factors that influence the likelihood of developing diabetes. We will clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generate insights from health parameters such as age, blood pressure, insulin levels, BMI, and others.

🛠️ Tools Used
Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
NumPy: For numerical operations and handling arrays.
Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive analysis and documentation.
📝 Procedure Followed
Step 1: Data Loading
Load the diabetes dataset into a pandas DataFrame for initial exploration.
Step 2: Data Cleaning
Check for Missing Values: Identify and handle missing or zero values (e.g., replacing them with mean or median).
Remove Duplicate Rows: Eliminate any duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
Convert Data Types: Ensure columns are of the correct data type (e.g., categorical variables encoded).
Outlier Detection: Detect and manage outliers in numerical features.
Step 3: Data Exploration
Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand the distribution of features.
Visualization: Use histograms, box plots, and pair plots to visualize the distribution of features and relationships between them.
Correlation Analysis: Analyze correlations between numerical features to identify potential predictors.
Feature Engineering: Create new features based on existing data, such as BMI from weight and height.
